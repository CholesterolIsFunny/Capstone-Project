    <h1>Starting out</h1>
    <p>Deepwoken is a hard game where many players you come across with be ruthless. In a world like this, its kill or be killed.</p>
    <h1>Character Customization</h1>
    <p>Firstly, you'll have to create your character. When first starting out you'll be given a completely random Race, each with their own Talents, Pros, and sometimes Cons. The Race you're given is locked to your Character Slot, however you can reroll for a different Race all with their own rarities. You can do this for 150 R$. You can reroll the variant of your character which will change appearances such as; skin color, hair color, eye color, and Race specific markings/cosemetics.</p>
    <h1>Weaponry</h1>
    <p>There are 3 main Weapon Categories in the game: Heavy, Medium, and Light. Each one with their own playstyle and list of obtainable weapons. The presented weapons are:</p>
    <h2>Sword</h2>
    <p>Balanced, Sturdy, and Wellrounded. The Sword is the mid-point of the other two weapon classes, with average damage, swing speed, and range. Having the largest list of obtainble weapons making it the most accessable in the game. This weapon is reccomended as a great starter weapon to learn a firm grasp of the combat mechanics on your first few runs, it's easy to learn but in due time can be mastered by the most capable of swordsman. Easly being able to adapt to multiple playstyles it is a reliable weapon for beginners and experienced players alike!</p>
    <h2>Battleaxe</h2>
    <p>Slow, Heavy Hitting, and Powerful. The Battleaxe is the other extreme of the Light Class, specializing in high damage and larger range at the cost of slower swing speeds. This Weapon Class best suites those who want to pursue a more defensive/passive playstyle focused on breaking opponets posture and creating distance. This Class features Hyper Armor which prevents the user to be hit mid swing without the swing being cancelled, Hyper Armor is activated swinging after a parry and is visualized by a red outline around the character. Reccomended to use once established with the basic combat mechanics, in the hands of the capable the Heavy Class can cause devistating amounts of damage if paired with synergizing Mantras. A soul shaking weapon capable of inflicting fear in a single swing.</p>
    <h2>Stiletto</h2>
    <p>Quick, Nimble, and Rapid. The Stiletto is the other extreme of the Heavy Class, specializing in faster swing speed at the cost of lower damage and range. This Weapon Class is best fitted for those who wish to punish mistakes and stun combo opponents. This Weapon Class features a variety of weapons such as Daggers, Fist Fighting Styles, and Flintlocks. Which also has a sub-class of Side Weapons of the Parrying Dagger and a offhand Flintlock. This Class however as of (1/9/22) is heavily controversal as bringing the balance in question, some members of the community have voiced that Light Weapons "Annoyingly Excell in PVP and perform poorly in PVE situations" compared to the other two Classes and as having the smallest list of obtainable weapons it's variety is lacking. This is the least reccomended due to it being difficult for beginners but for the time it is a weapon able to swiftly endure you in an endless barage of pain.</p>
